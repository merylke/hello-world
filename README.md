Seeing how this place works
I love going to Orangetheory Fitness every day. It's a great way to get the body moving, feel stronger and refresh the mind to conquer the day ahead. 

I love to read and watch too much TV. I have a useless talent for remembering TV facts. I'd rather remember what I did on January 10, 1998.
